| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Features

### Current Implementation

1. **Token-Based Authentication**
   - API endpoints protected with bearer tokens
   - Tokens stored securely in environment variables
   - No password storage in V1

2. **Environment Variables**
   - All secrets via environment variables
   - No hardcoded credentials
   - `.env` excluded from version control

3. **Input Validation**
   - Pydantic validation on all API inputs
   - SQL injection prevention via SQLAlchemy ORM
   - XSS protection in Jinja2 templates

4. **CORS Protection**
   - Configurable allowed origins
   - Credential handling restrictions

5. **Dependency Scanning**
   - Bandit for Python security linting
   - Pre-commit hooks for automated checks

### Planned Features (V2)

1. **WebAuthn/Passkeys**
   - Passwordless authentication
   - Hardware security key support
   - Biometric authentication

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - User roles (admin, developer, viewer)
   - Resource-level permissions
   - Audit logging

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - API request throttling
   - Brute force protection
   - DDoS mitigation

4. **Enhanced Audit Logging**
   - All actions logged
   - Immutable audit trail
   - Compliance reporting

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use `.env` for local development
   - Use environment variables in production
   - Rotate tokens regularly

2. **Update dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade -e '.[dev]'
   ```

3. **Run security scans**
   ```bash
   bandit -r backend/app
   ```

4. **Use pre-commit hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

5. **Follow secure coding practices**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize outputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Avoid eval/exec

### For Operators

1. **Use HTTPS in production**
   - TLS 1.3 preferred
   - Valid SSL certificates
   - HSTS headers

2. **Secure environment variables**
   - Use secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
   - Restrict access to `.env` files
   - Rotate credentials regularly

3. **Database security**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Enable encryption at rest
   - Restrict network access
   - Regular backups

4. **Network security**
   - Firewall rules
   - VPN for sensitive deployments
   - Private networks for databases

5. **Monitor and audit**
   - Enable application logging
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Regular security reviews

### For Air-Gapped Deployments

1. **Verify integrity**
   - Check package hashes
   - Use signed releases
   - Verify Docker image signatures

2. **Scan containers**
   - Trivy, Clair, or similar tools
   - Regular image updates
   - Minimal base images

3. **Isolated networks**
   - No external network access
   - Internal-only services
   - Controlled data transfer

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email security concerns to: [security contact - to be configured]
3. Provide detailed information:
   - Description of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: Within 7 days
  - High: Within 14 days
  - Medium: Within 30 days
  - Low: Next release

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow coordinated disclosure
- Public disclosure after fix is released
- Credit given to reporters (if desired)

## Security Checklist for Deployment

- [ ] All secrets in environment variables
- [ ] HTTPS enabled with valid certificate
- [ ] Database password is strong and unique
- [ ] MCP_TOKEN is long and randomly generated
- [ ] SECRET_KEY is cryptographically random
- [ ] CORS_ORIGINS restricted to known domains
- [ ] DEBUG=False in production
- [ ] Database backups configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting enabled
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks installed
- [ ] Dependencies up to date

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Breach

1. **Isolate**: Disconnect affected systems
2. **Assess**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Contain**: Stop the attack
4. **Eradicate**: Remove threat
5. **Recover**: Restore services
6. **Document**: Record timeline and actions
7. **Notify**: Inform affected parties
8. **Review**: Post-incident analysis
